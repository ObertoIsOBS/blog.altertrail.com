This is a big question. First you should know what an API is. Let's say you are making a website and you want to add the ability to search for the specs of any smartphone. Your first thought may be a web crawler to search the internet for you. What if I told you all this information is easily available in a refined list that can be accessed anywhere. Sounds great right? Well you're in luck, this is an API. APIs are a very simple concept, being the very reason they're so popular. An API in simple terms is the access point to a collection of data, usually in the form of JSON. At its very root, an API is just data that can be accessed via a link. **Why use an API?** Here are a few good reasons.
- Highly Maintained 
    - Rarity of downtime
    - Little to no vulnerabilities
- Much faster than older methods
    - Low latencies 
    - Returned metrics
- Flexibility
    - Options to push requests
    - Customized responses
I don't think I need to sell it to you anymore. APIs are so flexible they allow you to send data to them and receive custom data back and even add data in the case it is allowed. **Is it free?** Nowadays, the majority of APIs are free. But, the potential is so huge many companies are charging for it. But how could someone charge to visit these links? Most, if not all APIs require a token in order to access the API, Whether this be used to add rate limiting or to take some of your money, it is required. In many cases you can obtain a token for free and start accessing the API right away. **How is this useful in code?** The great thing about APIs, especially if you're familiar with Javascript, is the fact that API's return their data in the form of a JSON schema. This means it is beyond easy to filter out the results in your code. For example, in node.js you can use the built in modules to make a GET request to an API. In fact, many APIs have their own libraries to access the API easier. **Should I start an API?** APIs are in huge demand and becoming one of the most useful tools to modern companies. If you can get in on this age of APIs early on you are guaranteed success. Summing up, If you have not already it is time to switch to APIs and take advantage of them before none are free. The future of this amazing feat of technology is ever growing. I can only see better things coming forward.
